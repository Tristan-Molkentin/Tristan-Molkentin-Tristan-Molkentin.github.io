    <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;">It has been <em>three months</em> since I left home, which is the third planet called Earth.</p> 
        <img src=https://i.insider.com/5b48f100744a9821008b4a4a?width=1200&format=jpeg alt="earth" style="width:405px;height:202px;">
    <p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;">The journey to the next stop has been long. There is only so much to do while contained on a spaceship.
    I brought plenty of books however. The next stop is the planet Mars. <img src="https://www.rocketlawyer.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ThinkstockPhotos-89614571-c2.jpg" alt="Mars" style="width:405px;height:294px;"> There will be lots of new topological
    landmarks there, so I plan on staying for several days. The thing I am most excited to see there will be the
     south pole, but it will be <em>very</em> cold.</p>

<p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;">I just arrived at Jupiter, the <strong>largest</strong> planet in the star system, which is just another name
     for the heavenly bodies that orbit the sun. I am especially excited to drop down on Jupiter's many moons
    as their climates can contrast each other greatly. On the journey, I flew through the belt, which is waht people
call the strip of asteroids that orbit the sun. Some asteroids created some interesting shapes, but I am glad to be at
Jupiter. <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3afEX8a2jPg/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Jupiter;" style="width:405px;height:228px;"></p>

<h2 style="color:gold;font-family:Verdana;" id="J3">August 17, 2022</h2>
<p style="color:white;font-family:Arial;">We have finally made it to Pluto, the last of the famous planets. <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGqBq44gCE3CogJTXAnwjT.jpg" alt="Pluto" style="width:335px;height:335px;"> People often forget of the many dwarf planets
    including Pluto itself. I don't think there will be as many tourists at the last few dwarf planets, but eventually
     I will want to go home. The journey to Pluto has taken a long time, and I still have to get back to earth! I look
      forward to seeing the many ice structures on Pluto. Below is a top ten list for Mars, which was my favorite stop.
