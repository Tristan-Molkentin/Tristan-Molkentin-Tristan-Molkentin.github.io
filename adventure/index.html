<body><p>It has been three months since I left home, which is the third planet called Earth. IMAGE.
    The journey to the next stop has been long. There is only so much to do while contained on a spaceship.
    I brought plenty of books however. The next stop is the planet Mars. IMAGE. There will be lots of new topological
    landmarks there, so I plan on staying for several days. The thing I am most excited to see there will be the
     south pole, but it will be very cold.</p>

<p>I just arrived at Jupiter, the largest planet in the star system, which is just another name
     for the heavenly bodies that orbit the sun. I am especially excited to drop down on Jupiter's many moons
    as their climates can contrast each other greatly. On the journey, I flew through the belt, which is waht people
call the strip of asteroids that orbit the sun. Some asteroids created some interesting shapes, but I am glad to be at
Jupiter. IMAGE.</p>
<h2>August 17, 2022</h2>
<p>We have finally made it to Pluto, the last of the famous planets. IMAGE. People often forget of the many dwarf planets
    including Pluto itself. I don't think there will be as many tourists at the last few dwarf planets, but eventually
     I will want to go home. The journey to Pluto has taken a long time, and I still have to get back to earth! I look
      forward to seeing the many ice structures on Pluto. Below is a top ten list for Mars, which was my favorite stop.
</p>
<p>Mars top ten list: Olympus Mons, Tharsis Volcanoes, The South Pole, the North Pole, Medusae Fossae, Vallis Marineris,
     Gale Crater, Aeolis Mons, Hale Crater, Hellas Basin</p>
