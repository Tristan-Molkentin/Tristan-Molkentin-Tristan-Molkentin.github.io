    <h2>History of Tampa Bay</h2>
    <p>
In 1824, four companies from the U.S. Army settled the area to establish Fort Brooke. Development of the Tampa Bay region began after the territory became part of the United States in 1845. In spite of the blockade and Federal occupation during the Civil War, the area grew steadily.  Henry B. Plant's 1884 railroad extension to the Hillsborough River provided access to new areas, and he built lavish hotels along his rail line to attract visitors.
Tampa owes its commercial success to Tampa Bay and the Hillsborough River. When phosphates were discovered nearby in the late 1880s, the resulting mining and shippingindustries prompted a boom of growth and wealth that lasted through the 1890s. Tampa's port is now the seventh largest in the nation; today phosphate shipping is supplemented by trade in shrimp. A pleasure cruise line operates as well. The military has also had an ongoing role in Tampa's development.   The city was the primary outfitting and embarkation port for U.S. troops bound for Cuba during the Spanish-American War.  Today the U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command are headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base. Today, Tampa Bay is a center of tourism, industry, and military action.
